I invited my entire friend group plus their partners, one of my friend takes her dog everywhere. I told her no pets were allowed. Although it was a garden party we were in and out of my home and I have 4 cats. My cats do not like dogs and neither do I.\\n\\nAnyway my friend showed up with her dog, I told her that her dog was not welcome in my home or garden. And asked her to please take her dog home or elsewhere. \\n\\nI thought my friend left. I went inside to sort some things out. I went into my garden about 15 minutes later and my friend was standing there in my garden talking to our friends. She doesn\\u2019t live that close so I was confused. \\n\\nI went to ask her how she got back so quickly, she told me she just popped in and was going since her dog isn\\u2019t welcome. I asked her where her dog is and she shrugged her shoulders and said he was around. \\n\\nI went looking and found him at the bottom of the garden eating my crops and making a mess. I was angry and told my friend to get her dog off my property. \\n\\nA few hours later she called me asking me what her dog ate, I had no clue. My gardener plants and attends everything, I told her I didn\\u2019t know, but told her he\\u2019d made a huge mess, dug things up and clearly eaten things. \\n\\nShe shouted at me that her dog is sick and that I need to find out what the dog ate. I told her I had no idea, but I\\u2019d text my gardener to ask, but it was really her problem. \\n\\nI did send the text, but my gardener didn\\u2019t answer. My friend called again wanting to know what her dog ate, but I told her I still didn\\u2019t know. She told me I obviously don\\u2019t care if her dog dies and called me an AH.\\n\\nI still don\\u2019t know what her dog ate, but apparently he is very sick and might die. I feel bad, but I told her not to bring her dog on my property so I don\\u2019t feel responsible like she says I am. \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nETA - After being unable to reach my gardener I took pictures of everything the dog dug up, which was a lot and sent them to my friend, but I have no idea what it ate and what it just dug up and for all I know what it ate isn\\u2019t even pictured because the whole section is a mess. This wasn\\u2019t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don\\u2019t know and don\\u2019t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don\\u2019t even know if it can be figured out.\\n\\nETA 2 - My cats are house cats, they don\\u2019t go in my garden and aren\\u2019t at risk of getting sick from whatever my gardener is growing. My garden is huge and what is growing changes often so no I don\\u2019t keep track of what is planted. \\n\\nUpdate - I blocked ex friend after dozens of nasty calls and texts. But I got an update from a mutual friend. The dog is at dog hospital, dog is pretty sick, but is expected to make a full recovery. I managed to contact my gardener eventually, it looks like the dog ate some potatoes or something? A lot was destroyed so even my gardener isn\\u2019t 100% sure what was eaten, but he thinks maybe the pesticides were the problem. All info from gardener was passed to ex friend. \\n\\nEx friend has seen this post and is very angry about it. Everyone say hi to Suzanne!\",\n          \"I (25F) had a miscarriage in early January this year. I lost my mother to a completely unexpected heart attack in February. We used to be very very close and her death, coupled with the loss of my child devastated me. I slipped into depression, developed anorexia and lost a huge amount of weight in a very short time. I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. \\n\\nI attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my \\\"transformation\\\". \\n\\nThere was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my \\\"secret workout routine\\\" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of \\\"I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened\\\". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. \\n\\nI lost my patience and told her that \\\"I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine\\\". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.\\n\\nTurns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for \\\"embarrassing his sister on his wedding\\\". I've refused to apologise as of now and I'm not sure if I should.\\n\\nAITA for telling an acquaintance that my workout routine was depression?\",\n          \"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of \\\"fun\\\" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in \\\"acceptable\\\" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.\\n\\nAs a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the \\\"green\\\" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make \\\"cheese\\\" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.\\n\\nIt was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was \\\"unethical\\\" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?\\n\\n**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.\\n\\n**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"yta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 39,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 349,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          63,\n          67,\n          89\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 78,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 410,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 291,\n        \"samples\": [\n          121,\n          227,\n          77\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We\\u2019re very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. \\n\\nSo, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn\\u2019t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.\\n\\n2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn\\u2019t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it\\u2019s extremely concerning that he\\u2019s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. \\n\\nI went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn\\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, I didn\\u2019t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn\\u2019t answer.\\n\\n\\nUpdate: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn\\u2019t do anything wrong,she didn\\u2019t hurt my brother and it wasn\\u2019t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. \\n\\nAlso little info: this doesn\\u2019t happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.\",\n          \"My (M33) parents are late for everything. Like everything. Both of my sister's and myself have been disappointed so many times.  \\n\\nGraduation ceremonies, birthday parties, even my father's retirement dinner.  It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  \\n\\nI have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  \\n\\nWe are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. \\n\\nMy now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quincea\\u00f1era.  \\n\\nSo here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. \\n\\nWhen we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  \\n\\nMy mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  \\n\\nWhen she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  \\n\\nThe ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. \\n\\nThe problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  \\n\\nShe said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  \\n\\nMy idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  \\n\\nI came clean and told her about the \\\"special\\\" invitation.  \\n\\nShe is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  \\n\\nAITA,?\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nPart of the reason she is mad is because she had her invitation framed.  To be honest I was already planning a heist with my sisters to replace it with the real one in case she ever noticed the discrepancy between hers and the one we have framed in our home.\\n\\nEdit number two. \\n\\nYeah we are Latinos.  And no I do not in any way consider it racist how many of you guessed that.  I have been to Spain and it's an issue there too.  And the Philippines. Basically anywhere those guys were in charge.\\n\\nEdit three.  \\n\\nStop defending John. He and I have spent thirty years messing with each other.  I have an AITA story that ends with me getting an offensive tattoo ($5,000 for removal) and him getting a body cavity search at the Mexican border.  I would post it but it happened like ten years ago.\",\n          \"I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.\\n\\nThe pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week. \\n\\nWhen I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. \\nI started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it \\\"wasn't that bad\\\". My reply was \\\"fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up.\\\" Completly exhausted\\nI fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.\\n\\nThe following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  \\n\\nWhen my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.\\n\\nThat lead to a fight where I told him. \\\"I am too sick to have company and they need to leave\\\".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.\\n\\nMy mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. \\\"Since your family can stay so can we.\\\" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.\\n\\nI got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.\\n\\nEdited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.\\nMy house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.\\n\\nMy BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.\\n\\nSIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. \\nLast little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight. \\n\\nMy mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.\\nBoth moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.\\n\\nTalk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.\\nBil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.\\nSince then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. \\nHe admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. \\nHe begged me for another chance. \\nThe next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita.\\n We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.\\n\\nUpdate on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"yta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 41,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 349,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          63,\n          67,\n          89\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"nta\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 73,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 410,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 283,\n        \"samples\": [\n          155,\n          165,\n          157\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
